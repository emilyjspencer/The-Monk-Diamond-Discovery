       <p>The Monk Diamond was discovered by renowned Professor Harry Bairstone and Dr Ruby Day, 
           back in May of this year, during an expedition to the remote mountains of Siberia,
           in search of prehistoric fossils.</p>

        <p>The discovery was made after Bairstone's dog drew the academics' attention to 
            a large boulder in a cave. Upon closer examination of the rock face, Dr Day
            was startled to find a small box, wrapped in an oilcloth, in which they
            found the ancient jewel.</p>
