      <p><strong>The Monk Diamond</strong>, a highly-prized jewel, was discovered in <strong>1880</strong> and initially purchased
        by a Russian nobleman for his wife in <strong>1889</strong>.<br>
        It is over one <strong>billion</strong> years old, and its <strong>300</strong> carats
        make it worth more than <strong>Â£10 million.</strong>
                
      <p>During the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">Russian Revolution</a></strong>, 
        the Monk Diamond was stolen from the nobleman's palace in <strong>St Petersburg.</strong>
        For the next thirty years, the Monk Diamond's whereabouts was unknown.
        In <strong>1947</strong> it was discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in
        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">Moscow</a>.</strong>
        It was then returned to the nobleman's family</p>
                
        <p>Deciding that the jewel was perhaps a bad omen, the nobleman's son sold the Monk Diamond to the
        <strong>House of Volkov</strong>, Moscow's oldest jewellery house. 
        The House of Volkov paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumoured
        to be the most expensive diamond sale ever.<p>
                
        <p>The Monk Diamond was on display in the House of Volkov's private collection until 
        <strong>three</strong> years ago, when it was stolen in an audacious raid.
         Despite a long investigation and the promise of a huge reward, the police were
         unable to track down the culprits and the case has gone unsolved until now.</p>
