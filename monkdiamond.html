<h2>What is the Monk Diamond?</h2>
<p><strong>The Monk Diamond</strong> is one of the rarest and most precious diamonds in the world, famous
for its distinctive green colour. <br>
It was discovered in <strong>1880</strong> and purchased by a Russian nobelman
for his wife in <strong>1889</strong>.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is over one billion years old</li>
        <li>Green</li>
        <li>Oval cut</li>
        <li>300 carats</li>
        <li>Worth over Â£10 million</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>During the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">Russian Revolution</a></strong>, 
the Monk Diamond was stolen from the nobleman's palace in <strong>St Petersburg.</strong>
For the next thirty years, the Monk Diamond's whereabouts was unknown.
In <strong>1947</strong> it was discovered during a police raid on a gang of petty criminals in
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">Moscow</a>.</strong>
It was returned to the nobleman's family</p>

<p>Then nobleman's son decided the Monk Diamond was unlucky and sold it to the
<strong>House of Volkov</strong>, Moscow's oldest jewellery house. 
The House of Volkov paid an undisclosed sum for the jewel, but it was rumoured
to be the most expensive diamond sale ever.<p>

<p>The Monk Diamond was on display in the House of Volkov's private collection until 
<strong>three</strong> years ago, when it was stolen in an audacious raid.
Despite a long investigation and the promise of a huge reward, the police were
unable to track down the culprits and the case has gone unsolved until now.</p>

<p>Professor Bairstone reports thatt while exploring a cave yesterday, Bairstone's dog
' started barking and sniffing at the large boulder. We look closer and saw that
something that been hidden in a crack in the rock-face. Dr Day pulled out the object.
It was a small box, wrapped in oilcloth. When I opened the box, I couldn't believe
my eyes!'</p>

<p>The thieves behind this crime are believed to be the <strong>Bond Brothers</strong>, 
the international gange of jewel thieves responsible for numerous high profile thefts. 
A theory put forward by the explorer <strong>Bairstone</strong> is that the Monk Diamond
was smuggled out of Moscow by the <strong>Bond Brothers</strong> and hidden somewhere 
in <strong>Russia.</strong> He previously strated that he believed that <strong><em>'the thieves 
are biding their time until they can sell the diamond on the black market without
attracting suspicion.'</em></strong> In light of yesterday's remarkable discovery, it certainly
seems that Bairstone's theory holds water.</p>
